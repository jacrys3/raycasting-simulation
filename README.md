This project was made to simulate light emitting from a source and to show how the light is blocked by walls. This was done using raycasting, a computer graphics rendering algorithm. In the future I could use raycasting to be able to create other renders, possibly in 3D. 

To start the program use this command in the terminal:
```python renderer.py```
